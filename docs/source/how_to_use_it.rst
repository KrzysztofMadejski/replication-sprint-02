The difference of ``Crowdata`` from other similar software is that the people creating the document sets and forms don't need to have any coding experience. They can use the administrator interface to add documents and look at the entries from the community.


The Administration
==================


First we create a document set. It will have a name, description and a image to be displayed in its home page.



The field to sum on, is one of the fiels from the form (that we are going to add) that should be displayed as a sum in the home page.

In the same page, we can configure the form and add the fields that we are going to requests from the users.




For VozData Senate Spendings, we got the number for the spendings, who was the beneficiary, what is the category, a checkbox to say if the spending was noteworthy and a box for comments.

Next, we can add rankings to display in the home page.



Each ranking box will show sum, average or count on any of the  numeric fields and display a list in the home page.

Now that we have the document set configured, we need to add documents to it. First we need to have the documents somewhere. For VozData we use Document Cloud. We upload all the documents and then create a CSV with document url and document title.   Then we go back to the CrowData Administration and upload the CSV. This will create all the documents and associate them to the document set we created.


Exporting the data
==================

Whenever you want to download all the replies to your machine, you can export all CSV from the document set with just one click.
