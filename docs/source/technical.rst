Technical Introduction
======================

The basic features for 'Crowdata' are

* Store a set of documents (PDF or other formats supported by `Document Cloud <http://www.documentcloud.org>`_)

* Define a form, via the admin, for the information that wants to be extracted from the documents.

* Present users with a document and the form to allow anybody, that is registered to the website, to send us the information they see in the document.

* Have access to download the CSV of all the information extracted from the PDFs by the users.
